#Vue files

Here you will find 3 main components that I built from wireframes provided by my previous employer.

Considering this was my first experience with Javascript, node.js, Vue.js and Pug, I'd say that was a decent result.

Feel free to check out the code for the [Payment page](BrandPayment.vue), [Subscription Management page](BrandSubscription.vue)
or the [page Header](Header.vue).

Additionally, you can check the modals/popups I've created by heading to [this subdirectory](SubComponents), or take a look at the authorize.net
API scripts by heading to [this one](scripts).
